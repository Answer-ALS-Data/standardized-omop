I want to turn the input table into an OMOP table with the indicated fields. 
The name of the script will be <source_table>--<target_table>.py in lowercase
Include a logging file
The source_table is the name of the table in source_tables, but with .csv at the end.
The target table is the first part of the sheet name in caps, it should be saved the same as the script as .csv in lowercase, in the omop_tables folder
[] indicates data type, where [relative days] is days since the initial visit, and [integer option] is an integer that represents certain string values.
<> indicates putting the value of the variable directly into the final table
<<>> indicates using the value of the variable as an input to some function (named <source_table>_<source_variable>_to_<target_table>_<target_variable>) to fill the target table. 
	In most cases, this function is as simple as converting from the integer option to the corresponding _meaning column value. Notice that the source_meaning (often corresponding to _source_value) and target_meaning (often corrsponding to _concept_name) might be different
	In others it is using a relative day and index date to create a new date (index + relative_day). 
	There may be other functions that require some reasoning from context in the sheet to define
<<<>>> indicates using another sheet to fill the values for this source-target pair
/ alone indicates empty on purpose, and that it applies to all entries in the target table
A target_value with no brackets indicates to enter the literal text shown
Any _concept_id should have a corresponding _concept_name next to it corresponding to it's textual meaning (usually in it's target_meaning_ column)
if by the end, a target row have no concept_id it should be filled with code 0 with name No Matching Concept

Here is the set of tables, can you create the ETL code for this? I would like this general logic to apply to any other set of source-target tables:


Final column order: person_id	condition_concept_id	condition_concept_name	condition_source_value	condition_start_date	condition_type_concept_id	visit_occurrence_id
person_id = <Participant_ID>
condition_start_date = year_to_date(<medhxyr>) helper function to convert year yyyy to 01/01/yyyy
_type = 32851  (this is Healthcare professional filled survey)
_source_value = <medhxdsc> | equivalence: <medical_history_conditions_v2.csv:equivalence>

This includes an usagi mapping file, meaning we need to look up the source_meaning values for medhxdsc in source_tables/usagi/medical_history_conditions_v2.csv under sourceName, and use the corresponding conceptId and conceptName to populate the concept_id and concept_name
Only concepts with domainId = Condition should be used
if there are multiple exact matches in sourceName, then all of them are applied with a new row for each one (this corresponds to multiple mappings that all apply to the same entry)

use: from helpers import year_to_date, check_missing_concept_ids, get_visit_occurrence_id

CONDITION_OCCURRENCE-Medical_History
target_row_group	source_table	source_variable_1	source_value_1	source_meaning_1	source_variable_2	source_value_2	source_meaning_2	target_variable_1	target_value_1	target_meaning_1	target_variable_2	target_value_2	target_meaning_2	target_variable_3	target_value_3	target_meaning_3	Notes
1	Medical_History	medhxdsc	[text]					condition_concept_id	<<medhxdsc>>		condition_source_value	<<medhxdsc>>					
1	Medical_History	medhxyr	[year]					condition_start_date	<<medhxyr>>								Use 01/01 as month and day of year
