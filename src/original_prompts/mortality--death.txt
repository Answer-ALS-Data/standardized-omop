I want to turn the input table into an OMOP table with the indicated fields. 
The name of the script will be <source_table>--<target_table>.py in lowercase
Include a logging file
The source_table is the name of the table in source_tables, but with .csv at the end.
The target table is the first part of the sheet name in caps, it should be saved the same as the script as .csv in lowercase, in the omop_tables folder
A target_value with no brackets indicates to enter the literal text shown
Any _concept_id should have a corresponding _concept_name next to it corresponding to it's textual meaning (usually in it's target_meaning_ column)
if by the end, a target row have no concept_id it should be filled with code 0 with name No Matching Concept

person_id = <Participant_ID>
_date = relative_day_to_date(<dieddt>)
_type = 32851  (this is Healthcare professional filled survey)
_source_value = death_cause: <diedcaus> | icd10cm: <icd10cm> (if either empty, just leave as blank, no nan)

use: from helpers import relative_day_to_date, check_missing_concept_ids

This includes an mapping file, meaning we need to look up the values for diedcaus in source_tables/usagi/Mortality OMOP Mapping.csv , and use the corresponding cause_concept_id and cause_concept_name to populate the concept_id and concept_name

Final column order: person_id	death_date	death_type_concept_id		cause_concept_id	cause_concept_name	cause_source_value
